/* 
  The owners of Joey's Pizza want your team to develop some software
  that allows employees to build customer pizzas with 2 toppings, at the
  right size, get it paid for, bake it, and then output a message that
  it is being delivered.

  The delivery message should only happen if the pizza has been paid for.




  Goals of the pizza project:
  ---------------------------
    1. Function for adding the toppings to the pizza
    2. Function that bakes a pizza
    3. Function that adds `size` property to pizza
    4. Function to mark the pizza as being paid.
    5. Function that logs a "Your {pizza details} is being delivered".
          If pizza is not paid for yet, display "Please pay us first"
    6. Each function copies the input object and returns
          modified copy
